00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:26.860
[music]

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.696
Recognizing our members of the armed forces

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.266
who have fallen, and supporting those who have served,

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.869
and returned home is a strong,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.338
honored tradition of this campus.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.940
This part of our legacy as an institution

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.377
and where we will continue to lead in the future.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.780
We have long been the pioneer in higher education

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.616
that serves the physically disabled.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.418
After World War II, Dr. Nugent fought

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.454
tirelessly to make the entire campus accessible

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.390
to returning wounded war vets.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.625
Arguing rightfully,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.126
that wounds and physical limitations

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.396
were no reason to waste a fertile and productive life.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.732
Today, we take a giant step forward in continuing

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.902
this long storied tradition of being the leading

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.038
academic institution in the world for providing

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:16.075
higher education for those with physical disabilities.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.978
I'm sure you will all agree with me,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.915
this makes us all proud to be an Illini.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:26.586
We, right now, have over 400 student veterans on this campus,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.422
and more than 80% of them have served

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:33.293
in our most recent conflicts, in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:37.030
They are part of the diversity of experience

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.398
and perspective that brings excellence

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.732
to our campus.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.469
We're committed to developing services

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.804
to ensure that they have full access

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.307
to the Illinois experience.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:50.944
The Chez Family Foundation Center for Wounded Veterans

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.181
in Higher Education will serve as a national resource

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.785
for student veterans with severe and multiple injuries

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.688
that will provide access to comprehensive,

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.858
world class,
educational programs,

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.728
personal assistant support,
and will continue to develop

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:13.666
and disseminate best practices that will be developed here.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:17.270
What we will do here will
empower student veterans

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.007
to pursue their next
rewarding job assignment

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.409
and enable us all
to benefit from the

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.945
extraordinary
contributions they will

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:29.115
continue to make
to our nation.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.418
And, in the best of
military traditions,

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:35.822
even those with the most severe impairments will not

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.558
be forgotten or left behind.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.761
This generation is a generation like no other.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.298
Um, we're coming back with injuries that, that we,

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.900
that no generation has come back with.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.568
Double, triple amputees.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:52.672
Traumatic brain injuries that we're not ready for,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.607
and this gen...and nobody else is ready for.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.243
But the University had the forethought of being ready

00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:01.281
to transition and take on this next generation

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.383
and say, "Let's-let's go America,

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.185
let's hit this people, let's step forward and get ready,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.856
and let's take on this battle ,

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.360
and let's, let's, let's help these guys out."

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.096
When I was laying in the bed at Walter Reed,

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.398
and I looked down at my arm,

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.833
I had 30 seconds of pain for myself,

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.803
I'm like "I'm not going to let this injury

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.689
make me a different person."

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.475
I'm not going to let this injury define who I am.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.044
I'm going to define my injury,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.545
and that's what the Center's going to do.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.180
It's going to let these soldiers define

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.816
their injuries and become who they want to be.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.884
And thank you, Mr. Chez

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.352
and thank you, University of Illinois

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.154
and thank you, everybody who's, who's

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.557
donated to this and let's get some more.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.527
It takes all of us, from public agencies to really

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.228
generous families and citizens, to schools,

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:53.132
it takes all of us to support veterans in the transition

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.268
back to civilian life.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:59.572
The real heroes, the real heroes, are those

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:04.577
who have, uh, the courage, to serve in the military

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:08.581
and defend the country and to serve, uh, with honor,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.185
there is no greater, uh, service than to be

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.021
in the military and to defend the country.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:18.758
Our responsibility to everybody here is to do

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:23.963
more on behalf of Garrett and other veterans who

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:28.735
have demonstrated their service to America,

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:33.673
and so this great effort led by the University of Illinois

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.942
is a wonderful step in that direction.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:44.050
We are really incidental to that effort and it's our honor.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.718
Thank you.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.387
